## Problem Statement: Calculate Average Temperature for cities of a state

**From collections of temperatures of cities for different states, the program should calculate average of the city for the state selected**

**This exercise contains a class named Program with the following methods:**

     +GetStateWiseAverage() : int  
         - Should take index as input for selecting state and array with temperature values of cities for multiple states
         - The average of the array should be calculated by using a foreach loop 
         - The function should return average as integer value
         - The function should abnormally terminate for invalid index input
